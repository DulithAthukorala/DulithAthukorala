Hey there 👋

I’m **Dulith**, an AI & ML undergraduate,

I build end-to-end  machine learning and LLM-powered systems.

My work focuses on **NLP, CV, transformer architectures and modern GenAI systems**, with an emphasis on building things cleanly, correctly, and with intent.

This space is where I publish projects, experiments, and system-level explorations.  
Most work is implemented **from scratch**, with minimal abstractions and clear reasoning.
