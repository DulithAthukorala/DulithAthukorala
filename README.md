Hey there 👋

I’m **Dulith**, an AI & ML undergraduate at **IIT Colombo**.

I build machine learning and deep learning systems —  
from **math and theory** to **working, deployable apps**.

Most of my time goes into:
- Transformers & NLP
- Training models from scratch (yes, for understanding)
- Turning ML projects into real APIs and dashboards

I care a lot about **clean code**, **model internals**, and **engineering things properly** — not just getting results.

Currently:
- Building production-style ML projects
- Breaking and rebuilding models to understand them better
- Preparing for ML / AI internships

Fun facts:
- I enjoy debugging more than writing new code  
- I trust math more than tutorials  
- I probably over-engineer things on purpose
