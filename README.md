Hey there 👋

I’m **Dulith**, an AI & ML undergraduate,

I build end-to-end  machine learning and LLM-powered systems.

My work focuses on **NLP, transformer architectures, and modern GenAI systems**, with an emphasis on building things cleanly, correctly, and with intent.

This space is where I publish projects, experiments, and system-level explorations.  
Most work is implemented **from scratch**, with minimal abstractions and clear reasoning.

## Tools & Tech
- Python,NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn 
- PyTorch,tensorflow
- LangChain  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- FAISS, Chroma
- AWS / GCP
- FastAPI, Streamlit  
- Docker, Git, MLflow

## Currently Exploring
- Designing robust RAG architectures
- LangChain-based agentic systems
- LLM FineTuning
- Translating research ideas into reliable systems

---

## A Bit About Me
- I care deeply about **correctness and clarity**
- I optimize for systems that are understandable and extensible
- I trust first principles more than shortcuts
- I treat learning as an engineering process
